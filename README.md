Intonation-based identification of intention for Korean

# System Description
* First, this system detects the fragments.
* Next, if the input sentence clearly shows its intention among statement, question, command, rhetorical question and rhetorical question (idiomatic expression), this directly decides the intention.
* If the intonation information is indispensable, this requires an auxiliary input and makes an intonation-aided decision.
