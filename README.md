Intonation-based identification of intention for Korean

# System description
First, this system detects the fragments.
Next, if the input sentence clearly shows its intention among statement, question, command, rhetorical question and rhetorical question (idiomatic expression), this directly decides the intention.
If the intonation information is indispensable, this requires an auxiliary input and makes an intonation-aided decision.
